/* The match override the sweep depends on: an absent or empty request must
 * leave a run untouched, and a present one must fill every slot it was given.
 * Also covers the two M7 boundary callbacks: RNG is seeded before match setup
 * consumes item-spawn randomness, while scripted inputs are marked at the first
 * VS frame. A host that declines a seed must leave the RNG alone.
 * Exercised against a stub host so no disc image or game boot is needed.
 *
 * mu_apply_seed is stubbed here rather than linked from mu_snapshot.c: that file pulls in
 * random.h, and random.h drags in Runtime/platform.h, whose ssize_t conflicts with the one
 * mu_host.h gets from the Windows SDK's stdint.h in the same translation unit (the same reason
 * mu_entry.c keeps game headers out of itself). The stub only needs to record what it was given.
