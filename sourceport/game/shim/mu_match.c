/* The match a scripted run asked for.
 *
 * The sweep has to play every character on every stage. Driving the character
 * and stage screens by cursor position for each combination is slow and
 * fragile: one mistimed press and the run is testing the wrong thing without
 * saying so. The host takes --match instead and the game asks for it once, at
 * the point where a VS match's rules and players are finalised
 * (gmvsmelee.c, gmVsMelee_EnterVs). The menus still run exactly as they do for
 * a player; only the outcome is forced.
 *
 * Game code never includes mu_shim.h, so gmvsmelee.c declares this as plain
 * ints and the ABI stays on this side of the line.
