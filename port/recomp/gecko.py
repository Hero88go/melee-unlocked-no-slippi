"""Gecko code support for the recompiler.

Slippi Dolphin boots Melee with two code tables: `bootloader.gct` (installed by Dolphin at
0x800028B8 and applied once by codehandler.bin) and the main table generated from the enabled
codes of GALE01r2.ini, which the game itself fetches over the Slippi EXI device (commands D3/D4)
and applies with its own in-game handler (types 04, 06, 08, C0, C2). The recompiled code cannot
execute instructions the guest writes into RAM, so this module expresses every code as
instruction-level patches the recompiler applies ahead of time:
  * 32/16/8-bit and string writes are applied to the DOL image;
  * C2 hooks replace the hooked instruction with the cave's instructions (spliced in place);
  * hooks and C0 caves outside any function become synthetic functions.
The guest still runs the real handler at boot, so RAM ends up exactly as under Dolphin.
