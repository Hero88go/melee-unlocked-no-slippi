// The player's own Gecko codes, read from GeckoCodes.ini (Dolphin's format: a [Gecko] section of
// "$Name" headers followed by "XXXXXXXX YYYYYYYY" lines; a [Gecko_Enabled] section is honoured on
// first read). Each code is switched in the PC settings panel.
//
// WHAT CAN WORK HERE
// Codes that write (types 00, 02, 04 and 06) work: they are applied every frame, as the Gecko
// handler does. The game's code is translated to PC code ahead of time, so an instruction written
// into RAM would never be executed; on the Static Recomp a write into the game's code therefore
// also switches the function it lands in to its bytes in RAM (ppc::redirect_function_at, the way a
// mod's changed functions run), and switching the code off puts the original bytes back. The Source
// Port runs no PowerPC and has no console memory: there a code works only when every byte it writes
// or reads lands inside one game variable that the native game keeps with the console's layout (a
// number, an array of numbers, a string, or a member of a struct; user_gecko_targets.h, generated
// by tools/gecko_targets.py). The game library stores those bytes in its own variable, in host byte
// order (set_native_writer), and hands them back the same way (set_native_reader). On the Source
// Port a code may use every Gecko type whose whole effect is such reads and writes: 00, 02, 04, 06,
// the serial write 08, the same through the pointer (10 to 18), a base address or pointer set to a
// number (42, 4A) or stored (44, 4C), the if types 20 to 2E with their endifs (E2, an address
// ending in 1) and the terminator E0, and the Gecko registers (80 to 88). Each line is turned into
// a step with its address worked out when the code is read (Code::plan), so nothing a code computes
// at run time can become an address. The addresses follow the console handler's own arithmetic
// (port/slippi_sys/codehandler.bin): a line counts from the pointer in full, but only from the top
// seven bits of the base address, so a base address inside game memory counts as 80000000; 32-bit
// writes and ifs round the address down to a word, 16-bit ifs to a half; a base or pointer store
// (44, 4C) and a register operation on memory (86 with 2) always count their address from the base.
// One thing differs from the handler, which runs every code as one list: here each code starts
// with the base address and the pointer at 80000000 and no condition open, whatever the code
// before it left behind, and an F0 line ends that code only (the note above Compiler in
// user_gecko.cpp). Any other code is listed with the reason, naming the function
// or variable it touches, and cannot be switched on: one that writes or injects PowerPC (C0, C2,
// C6), follows a pointer read from game memory (40, 48), loops or jumps (60 to 68), or compares
// registers (A0 to AE). Static Recomp instead runs the shipped console handler in reserved guest
// memory, including assembly injections, pointers, loops, searches and register operations.
// Changed functions execute their RAM instructions. Source never links this runner.
// The codes Slippi ships, and the port's own (widescreen, PAL stock icons, screen
// shake), are translated in and do not come from this file; a code made only of their patches is
// shown as built in (native_equivalent).
//
// Imported codes run offline only and are suspended during online sessions and replay playback.
