// The player's own Gecko codes, read from GeckoCodes.ini (Dolphin's format: a [Gecko] section of
// "$Name" headers followed by "XXXXXXXX YYYYYYYY" lines; a [Gecko_Enabled] section is honoured on
// first read). Each code is switched in the PC settings panel.
//
// WHAT CAN WORK HERE
// Codes that write (types 00, 02, 04 and 06) work: they are applied every frame, as the Gecko
// handler does. The game's code is translated to PC code ahead of time, so an instruction written
// into RAM would never be executed; on the Static Recomp a write into the game's code therefore
// also switches the function it lands in to its bytes in RAM (ppc::redirect_function_at, the way a
// mod's changed functions run), and switching the code off puts the original bytes back. The Source
// Port runs no PowerPC, so there such a code is listed with the reason and cannot be switched on.
// C2 injections and the other handler-only types cannot run on either engine. The codes Slippi
// ships, and the port's own (widescreen, PAL stock icons, screen shake), are translated in and do
// not come from this file.
//
// Every code changes the game, so an online match only stays in sync when both players run the
// same ones. The panel says so whenever any code is on.
