// Named controller profiles: a saved set of the twelve GameCube action bindings for one kind of
// device, so a player can keep one layout for a box controller and another for a pad, or share one,
// and switch without rebinding every button.
//
// A profile is a small text file in a ControllerProfiles folder beside port-settings.ini:
//
//   # Melee Unlocked controller profile
//   device hid
//   A 1
//   B 2
//   ...
//
// The numbers are what the settings file already stores for that device (a virtual-key code for the
// keyboard, a button mask for every pad), so a profile means exactly what the live binding meant.
// A profile is only offered to, and only loads onto, the kind of device it was saved from: the same
// number is a different button on a different kind of controller.
