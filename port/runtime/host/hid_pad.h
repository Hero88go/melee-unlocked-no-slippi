// Generic USB/Bluetooth HID gamepads: B0XX, Frame1, vJoy and anything else that presents itself as
// an ordinary HID gamepad or joystick.
//
// The other pad paths in this port are written against a layout somebody worked out in advance: the
// DS4 reader knows axes start at byte 1, the Switch Pro reader knows report 0x30. A box controller
// cannot be read that way, because there is no single layout. What there is instead is the report
// descriptor the device publishes about itself, which Windows will parse for us through HidP. So
// this path discovers where the axes and buttons are at runtime rather than being told.
//
// Box controllers need no special maths from us. A B0XX or a Frame1 computes its own stick
// coordinates in firmware and reports them as ordinary analog axes, exactly as a real stick would,
// and a vJoy feeder does the same from the PC side. What they need is to be seen at all, and to have
// their axes left alone once they are: a deadzone applied to a box is what turns an exact wavedash
// angle into a wrong one, so there is none here.
